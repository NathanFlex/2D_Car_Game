# 2D_Car_Game

This repository contains Unity project files for a 2D racing game that I'm currently working on to understand Unity's 2D engine.

The game is currently still in development. It has a skeleton of a first level including a fully controlable race car, a racetrack with obstacles with collision, and starting lights designed to look like F1 starting lights. Currently the car is still able to move before the lights hit green, that feature will be implemented later.

All the sprites were made by me
